### This Metaheuristics Project aims to explore the use of metaheuristics in the search space of hyperparameter tuning of a high dimensional deep learning model.
### We will customise our own search operators and then apply the custom metaheuristics algorithms on the search space of hyperparameter values.
### We will then ask Python to return the best performing hyperparameter values.
### We will then perform K-Fold cross validation and take average performance for the best model, and its associated metaheuristics used.
### We will also compare metaheuristics method with the established methods like random search, exhaustive search and bayesian optimisation(yet to confirm due to high complexity).
